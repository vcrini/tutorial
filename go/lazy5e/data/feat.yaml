        - You have inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the right moment.
        - You have 3 luck points. Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional {@dice d20}. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the {@dice d20}s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.
        - You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a {@dice d20}, and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours. If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.
        - You regain your expended luck points when you finish a long rest.

        - You have learned a number of spells that you can cast as rituals. These spells are written in a ritual book, which you must have in hand while casting one of them.
        - 'When you choose this feat, you acquire a ritual book holding two 1st-level spells of your choice. Choose one of the following classes: {@filter bard|spells|level=1|class=bard|components & miscellaneous=ritual}, {@filter cleric|spells|level=1|class=cleric|components & miscellaneous=ritual}, {@filter druid|spells|level=1|class=druid|components & miscellaneous=ritual}, {@filter sorcerer|spells|level=1|class=sorcerer|components & miscellaneous=ritual}, {@filter warlock|spells|level=1|class=warlock|components & miscellaneous=ritual}, or {@filter wizard|spells|level=1|class=wizard|components & miscellaneous=ritual}. You must choose your spells from that class''s spell list, and the spells you choose must have the ritual tag. The class you choose also determines your spellcasting ability for these spells: Charisma for bard, sorcerer, or warlock; Wisdom for cleric or druid; or Intelligence for wizard.'
        - If you come across a spell in written form, such as a magical {@item spell scroll} or a wizard's spellbook, you might be able to add it to your ritual book. The spell must be on the spell list for the class you chose, the spell's level can be no higher than half your level (rounded up), and it must have the ritual tag. The process of copying the spell into your ritual book takes 2 hours per level of the spell, and costs 50 gp per level. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.

                - As a bonus action, you surround yourself with an aura of magical wind and lightning that extends 10 feet from you in every direction but not through {@quickref Cover||3||total cover}. The aura lasts until the start of your next turn or until you are incapacitated. While the aura is active, you have resistance to lightning and thunder damage. In addition, attack rolls against you have disadvantage, and whenever another creature starts its turn within the aura, you can force the creature to make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the modifier of the ability increased by this feat). On a failed save, the creature's speed is halved until the start of its next turn. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

            - The target takes an extra {@damage 1d6} lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn.
            - The saving throw DC for these effects equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Constitution modifier.
            - You can use this feat a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
